# Mars Exploration: Web Scraping & Data Analysis

# Summary:

This project explores Mars through web scraping and data analysis. Part one involves scraping titles and preview text from Mars news articles, while part two delves into analyzing Mars weather data. It utilizes automated browsing, Beautiful Soup, and Pandas to extract and analyze data, gaining insights into Mars' climate and news updates.

# Sample of Part 1 Results:
